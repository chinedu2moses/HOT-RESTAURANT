# Hot-Restaurant
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chinedu2moses/HOT-RESTAURANT/master/asset/dreamstime.jpg)
With this application, the goal is to have the front and the back end talk to each other. Take reservations or put people on a waiting list. Also make new reservations and go back home from any page. When server is restarted, the reservations will disappear because data is living only on the server, it is not hard coded.

# Getting Started

Basic Structure
Data and logic live on the Node server. Routes make the data and logic accessible. Ajax is used on those routes to push changes on the client front end side.

## To install
_Git Clone the repository

_Navigate to the folder where the repository exists

_Run the command $ npm init

_Run the command $ npm install body-parser express --save

_Then run the command $ node server.js

_Browser start with search for localhost:8080

NOTE: started with app.listen(3000) from express documentation but changed to var PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080
## Built With
> jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, 
> event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers
> AJAX is a technique for accessing web servers from a web page. It stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML and it is not a programming language.
